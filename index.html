         Garlic is a species in the onion genus, Allium. Its close relatives include the onion, shallot, leek, chive,
         and \
         the Chinese onion. With a history of human use of over 7,000 years, garlic is native to Central Asia and
         northeastern Iran, and has long been a common seasoning worldwide, with a history of several thousand years of
         human consumption and use. The bulb of the plant contains a number of allicin-rich compounds that give it a
         pungent, characteristic odor. When crushed, chopped, or chewed, the cells of the crushed clove release allicin,
         which gives garlic its characteristic smell. The majority of the health benefits of garlic are derived from its
         sulfur-containing compounds, such as allicin, ajoene, and alliin. These compounds are responsible for garlic's
         characteristic odor, and are also thought to be responsible for many of garlic's health benefits.

            Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) is an herb native to the Mediterranean region. The leaf and its oil are
            commonly used in food and also to make medicine.
            Rosemary seems to increase blood circulation when applied to the scalp, which might help hair follicles
            grow. Rosemary extract might also help protect the skin from sun damage.
            People commonly use rosemary for memory, indigestion, fatigue, hair loss, and many other purposes, but there
            is no good scientific evidence to support most of these uses.
